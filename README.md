Footnotes
=========

The Footnotes module enables you to insert automatically numbered footnotes
into Backdrop texts.

**Note:** This is a basic port of the Drupal version which is not yet fully working.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- In a text editor, where you want to add a footnote to your text, enclose the
footnote text within an `fn` tag.

- Example: This is some body text.`[fn]This is footnote text.[/fn]`

- The text within the tag will be replaced by a number with a link and moved
  to a footnote at the bottom of the page.
