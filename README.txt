Footnotes module can be used to easily create automatically numbered footnote 
references into an article or post (such as a reference to a URL). <strong>It
now supports also TinyMCE and CKEditor via WYSIWYG module</strong>.

This release also includes "Better URL filter", which can be used to replace the
(incomplete) URL filter available in Drupal 6.x. The code from Better URL filter
was committed into Drupal 7.x, so it will not appear as a separate module in the
Footnotes 7.x-2.x series.

<h3>ABOUT FOOTNOTES</h3>

The Footnotes module can be used to create automatically numbered footnotes
within a text. In the place where you want to add a footnote enclose the
footnote text within an fn tag: <code>[fn]like this[/fn]</code>. By default,
footnotes are placed at the end of the text. You can also use a
<code>[footnotes]</code> or <code>[footnotes /]</code> tag to position it
anywhere you want. 

The filter will take the text within the tag and move it to a footnote at the
bottom of the page. In it's place it will place a number which is also a link to
the footnote. As of version 2.0 Footnotes supports both <code>[fn]square
brackets[/fn]</code> and <code><fn>angle brackets</fn></code>. 

Also supported in 2.0 is the use of a "value" attribute to a) set the numbering
to use as a label or b) to set an arbitrary text string as label. Ex:
<code> [fn value="5"]This becomes footnote #5. Subsequent are #6, #7...[/fn]
 [fn value="*"]This footnote is assigned the label "*"[/fn]</code>

As of version 2.2 you can have multiple references to the same footnote in the
text body.
<code> [fn value="5"]This becomes footnote #5.[/fn]
 [fn value="5"]This is a reference to the same footnote #5, this text itself is
discarded.[/fn]</code>

Footnotes 2.4 supports both TinyMCE and CKEditor via plugins to the WYSIWYG
module. They each work slightly differently, please see the README for those
plugins to learn more.

<h3>If you are upgrading from 2.3 or earlier</h3>

Beginning with version 2.4, Footnotes will highlight the footnote text if you
click on the footnote reference link. (This was inspired by wikipedia, see
[#728658]). The highlight color is light gray. If this clashes with your site's
colors, or you just want to set a nicer color (or unset the feature altogether)
you need to override the default color in your own theme. (See below).

As part of this feature, CSS class names have moved tags. While unlikely, if you
have used these in your own themes, please change your CSS accordingly:
<ul>
<li>The "footnote" class used to be the A or SPAN element that is the footnote
number/label in the list of footnotes. This class is now the LI element
containing the entire footnote.</li>
<li>The A or SPAN element now has the class "footnote_label"</li>
</ul>

Due to changes in HTML and CSS, <strong>you need to clear the Drupal
cache</strong> after upgrading to version 2.4 or later.

Version 2.4 introduces an optional feature that identical footnotes are
collapsed into one, as if they had the same value="" attribute. This must be
enabled from admin/settings/filters by choosing the relevant "Input format" and
then the "Configure" tab. By default, footnotes are separate unless you specify
them to have the same value="" attribute.

The erroneously named "footnotes-aternative_layout.css" file had been kept for
backward compatibility but is now removed in 2.4. The correct file is
"footnotes-alternative_layout.css". This file was updated to reflect changes in
the default css file.

<h3>BETTER URL FILTER</h3>

This version of Footnotes includes also a "Better URL filter". This is a fork of
the URL filter in Drupal core filter.module. The original URL filter is buggy
and works particularly badly together with Footnotes.

<strong>Note: The code from Better URL filter has now been committed to
Drupal 7 core. It will remain in the 6.x-* series of Footnotes, but will
disappear from the 7.x-* series.</strong>

In particular Footnotes users have suffered from the Drupal URL filter not
converting URL's inside footnotes to links, however, the Better URL filter can
be used by anyone wishing more correct URL filter functionality, even if you
don't use footnotes. (You don't even need to enable the Footnotes filters to use
the Better URL filter.)


<h3>INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOOTNOTES.MODULE</h3>

1. Copy the contents of this module to modules/footnotes folder.
2. Login as site administrator.
3. Activate footnotes on the administer->modules page.
4. To use the footnotes filter in some input formats, go to administer->input
formats.
5. For selected input formats, select configure and activate a suitable
footnotes filter. 

Note: Typically you want the footnotes filter to be pretty early in the chain. 
If you need to lift the Footnotes filter higher up, click "rearrange".

Also see section about HTML filter below.


<h3>TIPS n TRICKS (CSS)</h3>

Many Footnotes users don't want the footnotes to show in teasers (such as the
front page listing). The correct way to prevent that is by using CSS. See
[#209037] for examples.

Beginning with version 2.4, Footnotes will highlight the footnote text if you
click on the footnote reference link. (This was inspired by wikipedia, see
[#728658]). The highlight color is light gray. If this clashes with your site's
colors, or you want to set a nicer color (or unset the feature
altogether) you need to override the default color in your own theme. The below
CSS can be used for that:

<code>
.see_footnote:target,
.footnotes .footnote:target {
  background-color: #ffeeee; /* Set footnote highlight color to light pink. */
}
.see_footnote:target {
  border: solid 1px #ffaaaa; /* Set border color of highlighted footnote ref to
light red. */
}
</code>

<h3>TEXTILE STYLE FOOTNOTES</h3>

There is also another filter which does the same with a Textile markup style.
Use it together with the Textile module.

Note: The Textile style filter is no longer actively developed and may become
deprecated. It is better to use the <code><fn>...</fn> or [fn]...[/fn]</code>
style footnotes with any markup you are using.



<h3>HTML FILTER</h3>

Footnotes.module is designed such that it can be used together with Drupal's
html filter, and in particular you should have footnotes first and html filter
later.

This version of Footnotes has been redesigned so that it only outputs html tags
that are allowed in a default installation of HTML filter. (Tags used are A, UL
and LI.)


<h3>KNOWN ISSUES</h3>

Version 2.0 uses a new markup for the list of footnotes. It is an UL list with
CSS taking away the browser generated list bullets and moving the link numbers
towards the left instead. All IE versions have a bug that the numbers are
slightly lower than the baseline of the footnote text. (If you know how to fix
this, please tell.) In addition IE 5.5 has a more serious bug that the footnote
number will be on top of the first letters of the footnote text. There doesn't
seem to be a way to fix this.

The Views API functionality only works in the common use case when footnotes
are at the end of the text, but does not work correctly when using [footnotes]
tag explicitly. See [#1003690] to follow up on this bug.

The development version of Drupal7 has a bug in that CSS and JavaScript files
added by modules are absent from the page. If you are hit by this bug, your
footnote references will not appear as supertext, and the list of footnotes will
have duplicate numbering. There is a workaround to empty Drupal's cache table
in Administer > Site Configuration > Performance > Clear cached data after which 
everything works again. To follow up on this bug, see [#279420]
